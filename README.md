# Lab 4
Turtle Graphics

All of the methods for this lab will be written in the TurtleGraphics.py file. In your main() function, you can uncomment one of the function calls. You only need to do one at a time but each of the given commands should work.

## Using CodeHS
There are two ways to work on this assignment.
- Copy/paste the code from TurtleGraphics.py into a [Code HS](https://codehs.com/explore/sandbox/python) using the Python with Turtle option.
  - Then when you are done, copy/paste back to your Github
- Copy/paste into your computer's Python IDE
  - Again you can copy/paste back to Github when you're done.


### drawPolygon(turtle, sides)
Will draw a polygon given the number of sides.

### fillCorner(turtle, corner)

1 - Top left
2 - Top right

## Testing your code
You may not actually know that your code works until you fully test what you have written. It is often a good idea to get someone else to run your program, they may do something you had not anticipated which could show you a possible flaw or at least a design issue.
